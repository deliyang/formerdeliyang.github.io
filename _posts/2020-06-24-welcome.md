I am a postgraduate student in the Department of International History at London School of Economics and Political Science (2021), and in the School of International Studies at Peking University (2020).

My research lies in signaling and mixed methods. Topics on which I have published or am currently working include the intersection between political apologies and post-war reconciliation, as well as the intersection of secret diplomacy and treaty compliance. My work has appeared in the Midwest Political Science Association (MPSA) Conference, or is forthcoming in the Contemporary Asia-Pacific Studies. I received the best paper award at the Peking University and the Sejoon Institute, and the award for outstanding research in the social sciences from the Ministry of Education of the People’s Republic of China.

I earned my LL.B in International Politics from China University of Political Science and Law (2019). Prior to coming to the LSE, I was a visiting graduate student in the Department of Political Science at University of California, Berkeley.
